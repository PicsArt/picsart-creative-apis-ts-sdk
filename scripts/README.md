## License

To run `./scripts/license.sh` on macOS, you need to install GNU sed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow these steps:

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **Install GNU sed**: Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install GNU sed:
```bash
brew install gnu-sed
```
